# Firefish

FireFish is a microcontroller board to enable both logging and real-time evaluation of underwater sensors in scientific diving applications. In particular, it is meant to enhance photogrammetry surveys through positional feedback and logging of additional metadata acquired through sonar, IMU, GPS, USBL and/or DVL.
